      "text" : "<p>The Hen and Chickens is a delightful and welcoming pub in Botley, just outside Chesham, managed by Helen. It fields two teams &ndash; &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;B&rsquo;. The two teams, by the way, are ranked not by quizzing ability but by charisma. So, if you&rsquo;re interested in seeing how the quiz works and are thinking about setting up a pub team of your own, you can turn up at the pub on almost any Tuesday evening at 8.30 between November and April and find out.</p>\n<p>The &lsquo;A&rsquo; team had never suffered relegation in its illustrious twenty or so years of history until 2012-13. Fortunately, we were spared the dreaded drop into the abyss of Division Two by the creation of a single division.</p>\n<h3>Steve (team captain)</h3>\n<p>Steve, a retired maths teacher, is a former BBC &lsquo;Film Buff of the Year&rsquo; competitor and cinema and television are obviously particular strengths. Other subject areas where he excels include pop and classical music, cricket, English literature and anything related to the United States &ndash; especially its geography and its boring sports (baseball and football). Areas for improvement: Fulham FC and the breeding habits of the palmate newt. His captaincy displays a skilful blend of authority when he knows he is right and disassociation when he is not (fortunately rather rare).</p>\n<h3>Jon</h3>\n<p>Jon is a former civil servant and an unusually civil one at that. He is also the only clean-shaven member of the team, which he claims makes him the most youthful-looking. Of all the team players, his knowledge of English literature is much the best, though he has been known to huff and puff if the definition of literature is broadened to include the likes of John Grisham. He is also particularly strong on football, cricket, 1960s pop music, cinema and current affairs. Knowledge of the finer aspects of palmate newts, however, continues to elude him &ndash; along with practically anything else in the broad field of science.</p>\n<h3>Neil&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Neil is a retired history teacher. He has good knowledge of several subjects including Fulham FC, 20th century French literature, Latin literature (all of which, of course, appear extremely frequently) and the bits of history he knows something about and Richard doesn&rsquo;t &ndash; sadly there are very few of those. He is good on the state capitals of the US, military history and the regnal dates of the kings and queens of England and Britain. Particular areas for improvement: anything to do with numbers, the geography of the British Isles, any of the sciences, cricket.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Paul&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Paul is a professional illustrator and spent many years illustrating the restaurant column of &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; Saturday magazine. Handily, this means he also knows a lot about food &ndash; a topic which appears surprisingly frequently in the quizzes. He also has a phenomenal knowledge of popular culture, encompassing not just pop music, TV (including an otherwise team Achilles&rsquo; Heel, Coronation Street) and film but also celebrities. Other areas of knowledge include English literature (especially Dickens) and, inevitably, art and artists from the Renaissance to the contemporary era. Areas for improvement: cricket.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Richard&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Richard is also a retired teacher &ndash; this time of history and politics. The only person who knew more about birds spent most of his life in prison. He is our default go-to guy for current affairs and anything related to the political history of the UK and the US. He has an inexhaustible array of knowledge of just about any sport &ndash; even the crappy ones like horse racing. Football, cricket and Rugby Union are particularly strong areas and the latter is especially important to the team as the rest of us are clueless about it. He is also very strong on natural history so knows all there is to know about palmate newts. Areas for improvement: Coronation Street and...that&rsquo;s about it.</p>",

And that's it. \"We may not be very good, but at least we turn up\", as the saying goes. We do, however, probably have the best record in the league of anyone when playing the perennial title winners Hen &amp; Chickens B. So on our day, we can beat anyone. Sad thing is, that day doesn't come along too often.

They slipped and Bloodaxe joined the carnage demanding Hydrogen Peroxide then Nitrous Oxide to grasp precious chemical points, Horse racing helped the Captain and Eric to grab another bonus then smash home Ayr for our points. A monumental chasm appeared 67-58\nRound 10; all we needed was calm contemplation, the initial movies were both named. They slipped on sushi so did we and they grabbed a bonus they were still fighting. They knew their Italian sportswear, we didn?t. They still battled on. D Day beached provided a safe haven as we staggered. It was over a magnificent battle we were triumphant but The Bell had pushed us all the way. They are emerging as a very tough team 71-65\n\n The treble was landed and we sat back, the drinks quiz was a honourable 18 all draw so we drank beer and eat a huge feast to celebrate the end of hostilities. A huge thank you to the Red Lion for hosting the final, we tipped our hats to The Bell for their magnificent performance and we went home avoiding Cliff Richard songs but our hats were at highly erotic angles.",

Such nice people but FCSC cruise onwards ignoring such niceties. 60-39  \nRound 8, another dollop of individuals, the RedLion had a nightmare and FCSC swept up the bonus points with unbelievable greed as the score soared and smugness almost set in. 71-43\nRound 9, both team stumbled, both teams grabbed bonuses, but the gap stayed the same , 78-50\nRound 10, so the fat lady sang and both teams eased off and leisurely dropped points with the lowest scoring round of the week 83-55\nFinal Score 83-55\nFCSC defended their unbeaten record with another great team performance.

You can sit outside The Squirrel with a pint of bitter watching the dying ember of a cricket match before the sun slides down into the Vale of Aylesbury. However, dear reader, if you return in dark of December a different contest awaits where no quarter is given by the battle hardened quartet in their quiz team. This week was no exception as they awaited the arrival of the rag tag renegades of Farnham Common Sports Club. Undefeated arrogant and vain they swaggered in as if they owned the place stake their claim on the corner table and sat waiting for the first blow. How we are allowed to progress beyond the M40 baffles most gentlefolk and once again, Alan & Nicola Morgan sat facing each other, the ever fractious Eric Harris glistened with intent and Captain Keith watched every move.\n\nThe toss was offered and the Captain called wrong; The Squirrel gave us the option to lead off.  The fuse was lit. The most titanic struggle erupted in this once genteel pub.\n\nA mutually perfect first round disguised the impending combustion as they dropped two question and we greedily grabbed the bonus to roar into a six point lead as boots thudded into unprotected soft bits. They smashed back as the captain dropped his musical question and they ripped the bonus from our mouths and clawed back into the match. 26 -23 \n\nThe fourth round lurched to them as we dropped a question but they missed the bonus and stayed perfect.  We flung ourselves forward for a perfect round five and they stumbled and dropped one. Again we missed the bonus, the gap was three points and we faced the second individuals 54-51.\n\nThey rushed and Caledonian war cries rent the air as they gave us a battering, both Morgans fell and they swooped on the slippery bonus and surged all over us. They took the lead 59-61 with two rounds to go. \n\nIt?s a simple equation -  if they get all of their questions right they win. They were perfect in round nine so were we 67 -69. The storm clouds gathered and the gods of quiz glared at the stand- off.\n\nRound ten they went first and staggered. They didn?t know the Olympic hopeful, cheesy, American, middle of the road, chart topper. They said Chuck Berry, incorrect. Mr Morgan growled Johnny Mathis and the world tilted on it axis. Our question on heavy metal chart topping fencers, Bring your daughter to the slaughter Bruce Dickinson. We were ahead by one and needed to be perfect for the rest of the round. We were. 76-75 was the final score. \n\nBoth teams slumped into their seats hardly believing the result. When tales of mighty contests are told this one will rank as one of the best. A feast was served and we went forward into the beer round. Again a battle royal but they sneaked it 18-20 by being perfect.\n\n\nWhen we are sitting in the Great Hall of Quiz Valhalla the table next to us must be reserved for the Squirrel it would be an honour to raise our hats and glasses in their direction.\n\nOutside the rain came down as Victoria and Nike wept tears of Joy, hats tilted at an indecent angle as we went home singing Run for the Hills. In the distance we noticed the blood red glow in the sky towards Botley. The Hen & Chickens B await next week, but that?s another day.",

The B team then won the last round 6-4 to run out 79-71 winners.\n\nB team also own the beer leg 20-18.",

Held at The Bell in Chartridge, the event featured questions set by Keith Nickless from Farnham Common Sports Club. Players were divided into four teams. Unlike in the real game hosted by Jeremy Paxman on BBC2, teams were of five or six people but that didn't spoil the fun.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Because of the way the teams were set up, it's not possible to say that \"The Bell won\" or that \"The Squirrel won\". Suffice to say that the team featuring Colin from Sugar Loaf, Terri from Bell B, Jon from Hen B, and two others (whose names escape me but I'll give them a plug if they want to remind me...) won all three matches. Everyone else won one and lost two (work it out...) in six games that were all evenly and closely fought.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>So everyone won or came second, how egalitarian is that? All must have prizes. Except there weren't any prizes, just a bit of fun for all, (and I suspect The Bell sold a few more pints than on the average Tuesday).</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Thanks and eternal glory go to Peter Jones, for organising the whole thing.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
